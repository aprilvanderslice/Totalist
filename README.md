# Totalist - shopping list app
Totalist is an app that allows you to create an actionable list. The difference between this list and all of the other commonly used digital lists is that it was built to estimate the cost of a list (think grocery list).

## Funtionality
A user creates an account and a their first list. Each list item added inclues an item name, store name (optional), the cost per item, and the quantity. The item total is calculated automatically and contributes to the list total at the top. A user can create multiple lists. 

## Tech Stack:
* React
* Node.js Express
* MySql

## Available Scripts
In the root project directory, run:

### `npm run dev`
Runs the development version of the app. You'll be able to run through the app as intended in a production environment.

## Progress Check / Stand Up

<br>

**Week 1**: Worked on integrating the front-end of the application with a backend API. Work for the week will include routes, models, data, logic, and the deployment of this work to Heroku.

**Week 2**: This week I'll focus on first nailing down the seed data that I started adding last milestone. After that I'll work on tests, login/signup authentication, and setting up React context.

**Week 3**: This week I had a family emergency and wasn't able to finish as much as I wanted. Instead of pushing through the beta release, I was still working on main features of the application. There is still some refactoring that can be done to make the code cleaner and easier to read. In the mess of just trying to get things to work, It seems there's a lot of repeated code and disorganization. I hope to remedy that this upcoming week.

**Week 4**:
