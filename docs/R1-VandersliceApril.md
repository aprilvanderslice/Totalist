## The Myths Of Creativity: Building A Better Mousetrap
Sheds light on the assumption that just because your idea is good, works, and is better than the conventional way of doing things, that people will accept the idea with open arms.

* People will find reasons a creative idea is bad rather than why it's good. Whatever the difference between the new and old idea has to be valuable enough for them to abandon what they're already comfortable with and getting people to change habits is very, very difficult.

## How to Define your Target Market: A Guid to Audience Research
Makes it clear that it's not enough to create something and then offer it to any and everybody. There is a specific person or type of person who is looking for specific type of product or idea. The goal is to think critically and find that person and offer your idea to them. 

* A target audience typically shares characteristics: lcoation, job, industry, gender, etc. 
* Compile data on existing customers and social media audience.
    * This isn't yet applicable to me, however, I can research the existing customers of existing apps that are similar to to the one I would like to build.
* Social listening. I think this is helpful to find out, as the article points out, what competitors and customers are saying about your brand. I also think this could help with scalability (how can a product grow to better serve its users) as well as seeing who else might be using the product that might not be part of the intended audience. 

### The Way I Select Product Ideas

A developer talks about how he chooses what to work on. 

* Makes a point that if an idea for a project is based on a current need then he doesn't do much research. This, of course, sounds like a dumb thing to say, but as my idea is the result of a current need, I have already done a lot of research from a user perspective trying to find a product that will work for me and only after failing did I decide that this is a scalable need. On the other hand, there is still other research to do like whether the product could serve more than one purpose and how to build it to do so if I want. The author of the article does do things that I think falls under conventional research methods like considering its scalability, profitability, complexity, etc

What resource(s) did you find most helpful for this research assignment and why?
I found the Myths of Creativity resource very helpful because prior to reading it I though people would change their minds if something new and exciting came up. However, thinking as a consumer, I know that this is not true. I sometimes fall prey to pretty packaging and claims, but generally I'm not going to change something that I know works. Because the idea i'm leaning toward could be considered reinventing the wheel or another mousetrap idea, I need to truly highlight the big difference between my product and the others, and how that's its biggest value.
