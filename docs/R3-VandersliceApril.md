## Website color schemes: Theory, practice, and inspiration
This article explains the important role that colors play in a project's branding and offers a list of best practices that can help when deciding colors. 

* The color should reflect the brand. Consider whether the brand already has an established color scheme (and then follow it), or if it needs to be chosen from scratch.
* Color theory: if it's necessary to choose a color theme from scratch, consider the psychology of colors. The meaning of a particular color can differ from country to country. Colors can also influence feelings too so make sure the chosen colors reflect what the product intends to make users feel. 
* Target Markets: Identifying the target market, or who you expect your primary users to be, will help determine what color scheme should be chosen
