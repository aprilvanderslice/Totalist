## Clean Code vs. Dirty Code: React Best Practices
Clean code is a way to write code that follows the best practices used in the industry by professionals.

Characteristics of clean code: 
* Passes the smell test: if it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. 
* DRY: Don't repeat yourself. Consolidate duplicate code, find patterns in your code that can be abstracted out. 
* Predictable and testable: unit tests help you see how and where certain features can create bugs in other places.  
* self-commenting: the code speaks for itself and/or is well commented. Comments don't just repeat what the code already tells us, it explains the *why* behind a certain block of code.
* Naming is consistent
* follows best practices for design patterns

## The Order of CSS
CSS files even for small project can get out of hand and hard to manage. There are common ways that CSS is managed that make it easier for all developers on a project to understand.

* Ways to sort: alphabetically, don't sort/organize at all, group properties by sense
* A more intentional way is to sort blocks of css in groups or clusters following the separation of concerns: color, borders, layout, etc.


## Good Documentation
Comments in code are essential to a well-written application. Knowing why and how to comment is challenging, and there are many differing opinions. This article provides a look at a well-thought-out process on how to document code.

* There's no such thing as self-documenting code. Common belief is that if the code is written well, it will not require comments. While that statement is true, documentation isn't always about *what* the code does, it's more about they *why*. That's where the comments come in.
* Still, comments should be use sparsely, again, as a way to explain why the code was written instead of explaining what the code does. 
* Avoid redundancy in comments. For example: if a function returns a variable, a comment above that says "returns [variable name]" would be redundant and messy.
* If you can think of what to write, ask yourself why the code was written.
* documentation is often seen as something *beside* the actual code, but it should be seen as something that's part of it. 


## How to Write a Good README File
The README document is the first file to be read when starting a new project. 

* A good README is how you explain your code to others: how to get started when using it.
* Because out Github portfolios are often used to display our skills and accomplishments as developers, it's important that there's an introduction to each repo with a readme
* elements to include: titles, internal titles, introduction - the project's aim, technologies, launch
* It might also help to include table of contents, illustrations, scope of functionalitites, examples of use, sources.

## About Page
An about page is critical to an application. It shows users what the purpose of the project is all about, and why they should care. There are many ways to write and design an about page. Here are some excellent examples that may inspire your own approach to engaging the audience.

* The About Us page explains why a customer should emotionally invest in your brand. 
* Things to include in an About Us page:
    * how you started your brand
    * what makes your brand unique
    * what are your brand values and beliefs
    * why customers should choose you
* New visitors rely on About Us pages to figure out if your app is what they're looking for to solve a particular problem.
