# Tech Stack

Fill out the headings below with your familiarly and comfort level with each piece of technology.


## Adobe XD

You are going to be using XD to create click-through designs of your application. It is recommended that you use an UI kit for a visual framework to help you design your applications as similarly to the potential live version as possible.

**How comfortable do you feel with XD?**
While I wouldn't call myself and XD expert, I am very comfortable using it to create visual frameworks.

**What are your concerns around using XD?**
I can also use a bit of practice creating, using, and then reusing, components. In my most recent experiences with XD, I found that I would create a component, change my mind about it, and then try to make changes to it. I think making changes is fine, but it seemed that somewhere along the way I'd created a disconnect between all the instances of that component so they wouldn't all update. 

## React

You will be utilizing React as your front-end framework. You will be expected to use moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.

**How comfortable do you feel with React?**
I am comfortable using and exploring React. 

**What are your concerns around using React?**
Not an expert, but I feel confident in my ability to navigate the React docs to get help accomplishing a goal. 

## Redux

Redux will be used to control your data and have proper data flow for your app. You will be expected to create well organized reducers, well built actions, and connected components.

**How comfortable do you feel with Redux?**
Not very comfortable.

**What are your concerns around using Redux?**
I only vaguely remember using Redux in previous courses and will probably need to do a lot of research. 

## Node

You will be using Node as your server for both your API and to render your front-end. You will be required to use best practices, npm, and npx.

**How comfortable do you feel with Node?**
Fairly comfortable because I used it in my class last month.

**What are your concerns around using Node?**
The 'why'. My experience has been that an instructor says 'you need this piece of code, and this, and this' but I don't have a concrete understanding of how and why everything works together to make everything work. 

## Express

You will be using express as your framework for your API. You will be using and building middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

**How comfortable do you feel with Express?**
Fairly comfortable. 

**What are your concerns around using Express?**
Same as above. I feel comfortable navigating the code but I don't feel I have a concrete understanding of how and why everything works together.

## SQL/Posgres/Sequelize

You will be utilizing a relational database with Sequelize as an ORM. You will be creating migrations, models, and seeds as well utilizing the models with full validated CRUD.

**How comfortable do you feel with Sequelize?**
Somewhat comfortable. 

**What are your concerns around using Sequelize?**
I definitely need a refresher.
