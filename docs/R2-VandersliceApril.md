## Why Wireframe?
The author tells us why we should resist the urge to skip the wireframing stage and go straight to the main product. 

* Wireframes allow for website feature clarification. In meetings words that describe the parts of a website won't mean much. It makes more of an impact for someone to see the hero image at the top of a page, or to visualize where the menu and logo will go. 
* Without creative influence, more focus is placed on functionality. 
* A wireframe also allows us to focus more on usability and less on looks. Does it make sense for there to be a bottom menu bar or is it better to have a drawer slide out. 
* Wireframes allow you to make changes to accomodate for scalability. It would be difficult to try and rebuild a completed website to make space for more products.
* Wireframes allow the construction of a product to be iterative (and in my opinion, cleaner). First focus on the main elements, etc. It's easier to receive feedback on one thing at a time instead of everything at the same time.

## The Importance of Wireframing for a Responsive Website
Things to avoid when wireframing to keep the process clean and productive.  

* Avoid emphasizing color & design. The main focus of wireframing is deciding the layout and location of elements. 
* Avoid too much detail. This is why drawing on paper is a good way to wireframe. 
* No need to wireframe every page. Getting just enough consesus to move the project forward is the goal.

What resource(s) did you find most helpful for this research assignment and why?
I think the article on why it's important to wireframe was especially helpful. I admit I've fallen into the trap of not wanting to wireframe and instead just get straight to building. What the author says is true: wireframing definitely saves time. I typically end up so focused on building the perfect button *then* trying to figure out where it goes only to realize it doesn't look right in that spot. I will definitely spend more time wireframing and focus less on detail.
