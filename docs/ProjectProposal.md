# List Total

## Application Definition Statement

The main goal is to create a shopping list program. It will be some mix of a checklist app, that allows user to easily add and then check items off of a list, and a spreadsheet program to total the cost of the items on the list. The list should be easy and actionable. 

## Target Market

Ideally this app could work for anyone who makes grocery lists, but it will work best for those who are already using a mobile device to manage their lifestyle. 

## User Profile

A young professional who is working at managing money.
The person in a household who does most of the shopping for the home.

## Use Cases

Anyone who would like to get an idea of how much will be spent for specific projects by planning things out in a list and then using that list to head to a store and mark off items. Also anyone and is trying to keep shopping trips within a certain budget. 

## Problem Statement
There is an easy way to make actionable lists to shop with on a mobile device. There's also a way to create a spreadsheet of expected expenses. There is not an app that allows you to make an actionable shopping list that also shows the total of the list.

## Pain Points
It seems that because there are spreadsheet apps that can be operated on a mobile device that the solution has already been found. However, using spreadsheets on a mobile device is even more tedious than doing so on a computer or tablet. It is not easy to add items or mark off those items. 

## Solution Statement
The main focus of this project is to provide a simple, actionable shopping list that also provides more detail than an average to do list app would. 

## Competition
There is only one other app I found that is similar to the one I would like to build, however, it is defined as a budgeting app. The other competitors are spreadsheet programs and other to do list apps. 

## Key Features
Adding an item to the list includes adding an item name and a cost. Items can be completed, deleted, or removed. If the user wishes to add more information to the item, such as store location or an image, that functionality will be provided by tapping the edit button. 


## Integrations
I would like users to be able to login and keep their lists. And because this app was initially meant as a grocery list app, I would like to try to integrate with the Kroger grocery item api.
