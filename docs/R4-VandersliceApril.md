## Confirmshaming
The article talks about a trend of companies being passive agressive about users saying clicking "no." Consequences are discussed both as a business taking part in confirmshaming and how, as a user, to handle being a target. 

* Example: in order for a user to decline marketing emails they have to click something that isn't technically true like "no, I don't like saving money," or, as mentioned in the article, "no, I don't like the outdoors."
* This strategy is insulting to customers/users and breaks their trust.
* Several companies no longer confirmshame if enough users push back so in the instance that you are personally experiencing it, send an email letting the company know how it negative affects you.

## 15 Timeless Rules for Cerating Web Apps
There are plenty of common practices when it comes to designing a web app and the article lists them off to help designers avoid common mistakes. 

* Show transition. For example, instead of a menu just appearing when you click the drop down, show it sliding out or down. 
* Design for no data. In the design process we use dummy data but it's also important to design for when there isn't any data, which is how it will look when a user first starts using the app.
* Less is better. While there are always things we can add to improve our project, focusing on making it easy to use for users is best. Less important features shouldln't take up space where the core functionality of the app is.
* Provide feedback. Along with showing transition, make use of other ways to provide feedback like animations for button pushes, maybe haptic feedback.

## 15 Timeless Rules for Cerating Web Apps
This is another article that talks about the importance of using wireframes, but it offers more information than other articles on the same topic: 

* While in the wireframing stage, "agree on artefacts, their definition, naming and attributes." I typically don't start considering naming until the development stage, but it makes so much more sense to do it prior.

What resource(s) did you find most helpful for this research assignment and why?
The medium article on Space in Design Systems really made spacing make sense. I didn't realize what was meant by consistent spacing until I read this article.

Searched for apps in the same industry as mine to look at placement of elements and colors.
