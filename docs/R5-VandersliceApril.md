## How to Design an API
Basic steps and things to avoid when creating an API  

* Base URL should be simple. Use nouns (not verbs). `/lists` gets all lists. `/lists/1234` grabs a specific list. 
* Use parameters: `/lists?name=groceries` or `/lists?type=xyz`
* Use proper HTTP codes. The numbered status codes that tell you whether the request was ok or failed.

## Documentation Driven Development

## Breaking Your Designs Down
Thinking about REACT atomically: the structure of your project should be similar to atoms, molecules, and organisms. 

* Atoms are the very basic building block. They should be dumb (no access to business logic), and they should dynamically render data by taking in the data as variables.
* You can combine atoms to make molecules, and as a continuation of the 'dumb' atoms that built them, they should also be dumb. It shouldn't itself handle business logic. 
* Organisms are groups of complext UI elements that make up pages. The organisms may handle business logic. Example: Navbar organism. Organisms can combine to make templates.

What resource(s) did you find most helpful for this research assignment and why? 
Designing the API has been the cause of a bit of stress and anxiety but I found the article on how to design one very helpful. I also am kind of excited to dive into atomically structring my project (which I haven't really done before building a project) and see how it helps with the development process.
